   A colour of your own.

   The picker used to open on the same green for everyone, and most people
   quite reasonably left it there — ninety-one of the first hundred and
   twenty-six ended up sharing a colour with somebody, which makes the charts
   and the live strip much harder to read than they need to be.

   So a new arrival is handed one nobody has yet. Hues are stepped by the
   golden angle so consecutive ones land far apart, and each is solved for a
   contrast ratio against white between about 4.6 and 9.6 to one — the colour
   is both the background behind white initials and the text of a name on a
   white card, and that one number keeps them both readable.

   Nobody is stuck with it: the picker is still there and still does whatever
   you tell it.

   REALTIME, AND WHAT IT IS NOT USED FOR

   68,000 changes a day, each copied to every open tab — millions of
   messages a month, almost all of them saying "still going". Sessions were
   the next biggest. Both are now read by polling instead (timers every 30
   seconds, the rollup every 2 minutes, a few kilobytes each), and the
   database no longer publishes those tables at all.

   What stays live is what has to feel live and is small: chat, its
   reactions, profile edits and your own nudges.

   A tab left in the background lets go of the socket after two minutes and
   catches up when it comes back, so a laptop with the app open all night is
   not on the bill all night.

   stops itself — paused, not discarded, and clamped to the cap so the figure
   waiting for you is a plausible one you can still adjust before saving.

   And a paused timer stops beating. The strip works out who is here from how
   recently a timer checked in, so a pause that no longer checks in falls off
   it by itself after a while, instead of a session paused yesterday lunchtime
   still sitting between two people who are actually working.

   POMODORO

   An optional way of running the same timer, chosen when you press Start:
   focus for 25 minutes, break for 5, and after every fourth round a long one.
   It is not a second clock. A focus round is the timer running and a break is
   the timer paused, so everything that already reads the timer — the strip,
   today's total, the save sheet, the six hour cap — comes out right without
   knowing pomodoro exists.

   localTimer.pomo holds the cycle and travels with the timer: into the
   live_timers row (pomo.sql), so a reload or another device picks it up and
   the strip can say "break" rather than "paused", and to your other tabs on
   the same channel as everything else.
     focus, brk, long  minutes; every: rounds to a long break
     round             1-based: the round under way, or the one just finished
     phase             "focus" | "break" | "ready" (break over, waiting on you)
     base              acc_ms when this round's focus began
     ends              when the break finishes (ISO), during a break
     id                fixed for the session, so each bell rings once across tabs

   A break never rolls into the next round by itself. Hours that count have
   to be hours somebody started, so when a break ends the bell rings and
   Start waits for you.

   BEING REACTED TO

   Reactions already arrive with the ordinary reads: your own sessions carry
   their counts, and your own timer's are in with everybody else's. So nothing
   new is fetched — this only works out which of them you have not seen yet.

   "Seen" is kept per device in localStorage rather than in the database. It
   is a read receipt for a shrug, and a table of four hundred people's read
   receipts is a real cost for something nobody would miss.

   The first run on a device seeds the list without announcing anything.
   Otherwise installing the app on your phone would open with two weeks of
   kudos you have already had on your laptop.

   Only sessions saved in the last RX_RECENT_H hours, and the timer running
   now, are looked at. It is news about what you just did. Looking at every
   session ever overflowed the seen list (it keeps 800; most people have
   more reactions than that), so the oldest kept falling out of it and
   coming back as new on every load. v2 of the key starts everyone over,

     · names, colours and hours are already in this client — profiles and
       the daily rollup — so the badge beside somebody's name is a lookup,
       not a query. The whole ornament is free.

   A NEW VERSION, WHILE THE APP IS OPEN
   GitHub Pages serves a new app.js the moment a change is merged, but a tab
   that was already open keeps running the old one until somebody reloads it,
   which on a laptop that never closes can be days. So every 10 minutes, and
   whenever the tab comes back into view, this asks Pages whether app.js has
   changed: a HEAD request, a few hundred bytes, nothing from Supabase.

   When it has: a tab in the background with nothing half-done reloads by
   itself; one in front of somebody shows a bar and leaves the reload to
   them, so it never happens under their hands. Dismissed, it reloads the
   next time the tab goes into the background. A running timer lives in the
   database, so a reload never loses one.
