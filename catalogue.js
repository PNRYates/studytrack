   HSC CATALOGUE — Knox Grammar subject list, 2026 cohort
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Every subject Knox has presented at the HSC, with:
     · exams  — every written paper, hard-coded from the official NESA
                "2026 HSC written examination timetable" (version 01-05-26).
     · areas  — the sections/modules the course is actually built from,
                taken from the NESA Stage 6 syllabus and exam specifications.

   This is a STARTING POINT, not a rule. Everything it fills in — the name,
   the colour, the exam date, every area — is editable, removable and
   addable-to in the app afterwards. Nothing here is enforced.

   Marked `retired: true` are courses Knox has presented in the past that no
   longer have a 2026 HSC exam. They stay searchable so old data still maps,
   but they are hidden from the picker unless you ask for them.
